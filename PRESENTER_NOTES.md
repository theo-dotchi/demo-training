# GitHub Actions Live Demo — Presenter Notes

## Overview
This is a training/interview demo showing GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation. The demo repo has a React + TypeScript app with tests, and you'll create workflows live to show automation.

---

## Act 1: The Application (2-3 min)

**Show the running app** at `http://localhost:5173`

**Say:**
> "This is a simple React + TypeScript application built with Vite. It demonstrates the checklist of what we'll do today. But the real demo is about automation — how we can use GitHub Actions to run tests, check dependencies, and deploy automatically on every push."

**Point out:**
- The app has a test suite (Vitest)
- Clean, simple UI showing the demo flow
- Running locally for now

**Transition:** "Let's go to GitHub and create the workflows."

---

## Act 2: Create CI Workflow Manually (5-7 min)

**Navigate to GitHub:**
1. Go to https://github.com/theo-dotchi/demo-app (on `main` branch)
2. Click **Add file** → **Create new file**
3. Path: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Explain the structure:**
> "GitHub Actions workflows are YAML files in the `.github/workflows` folder. Each workflow defines jobs and steps that run automatically on events like push or pull request."

**Type/paste the CI workflow:**
```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm run test
```

**Explain each section:**
- **`on:`** — When the workflow triggers (push, PR)
- **`jobs:`** — What to run
- **`runs-on: ubuntu-latest`** — The runner environment
- **`uses: actions/checkout@v4`** — First step: get the code (from GitHub's official action)
- **`uses: actions/setup-node@v4`** — Second step: set up Node (cached npm for speed)
- **`run: npm ci`** — Install exact dependency versions
- **`run: npm run test`** — Execute tests

**Show the action repo:**
> "These `uses:` lines reference actions maintained by GitHub. Let me show you — I can click on `actions/checkout` and it opens the official repo where this action lives."

Open https://github.com/actions/checkout in a new tab for 10 seconds, then go back.

**Commit the file:**
- Message: `"ci: add workflow to run tests"`
- Commit directly to `main`

**Say:**
> "Now every push will automatically run tests. Let's add one more workflow using the Marketplace."

---

## Act 3: Add Dependency Review from Marketplace (3-5 min)

**Go to Actions tab:**
1. Click **Actions** tab on the repo
2. Click **New workflow** (or search in Marketplace)
3. Search: `Dependency Review`
4. Find `github/dependency-review-action` (official GitHub action)
5. Click **Configure**

**Explain:**
> "Instead of writing this from scratch, I'm using a pre-built action from the GitHub Marketplace. This one automatically checks for known vulnerabilities in dependencies when you open a pull request."

**The workflow auto-generates.** Review the file:
```yaml
name: Dependency Review

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Dependency review
        uses: github/dependency-review-action@v4
```

**Say:**
> "It's pre-configured to fail on high-severity issues. This will catch risky dependencies automatically. Let's commit it."

**Commit the file:**
- Message: `"ci: add dependency review action"`

---

## Act 4: Push Code Changes (2-3 min)

**In VS Code (or terminal):**

Show that you've already:
1. Added a new dependency: `minimist@0.0.8` (intentionally risky version)
2. Made a small code change (e.g., added a feature)

**Run:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add feature with new dependency"
git push
```

**Say:**
> "Now I'm pushing a change that adds a dependency with known vulnerabilities. Watch what happens when this triggers the workflows..."

---

## Act 5: Watch Workflows Run (5-10 min)

**Go back to GitHub:**
1. Refresh the repo
2. You should see a new commit on `main`
3. Click **Actions** tab
4. Watch both workflows execute (~30-60 seconds)

**Explain what's happening:**
- **CI workflow:** ✅ **Passes** — Tests are green
- **Dependency Review:** ❌ **Fails** — Detects minimist@0.0.8 vulnerability

**Show the failure details:**
1. Click the failed **Dependency Review** run
2. Expand the logs
3. Read the advisory message explaining why it failed

**Say:**
> "The workflow detected a known high-severity vulnerability in minimist 0.0.8. This is exactly what we want — automation catching security issues before they go live."

---

## Act 6: Fix and Re-run (3-5 min)

**In VS Code / Terminal:**

Update the dependency to a safe version:
```bash
npm install minimist@1.2.8
git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "fix: update minimist to safe version"
git push
```

**Say:**
> "Now let's fix the vulnerability and push again. The workflow will automatically re-run."

**Watch it turn green:**
1. Go back to **Actions** tab
2. Watch the new run (CI passes again, Dependency Review now passes ✅)

**Say:**
> "Both workflows are now green. Everything is clean. If this were production, we could now safely merge and deploy."

---

## Act 7: Deploy (Optional / Time Permitting)

**If time allows:**

Create the Azure deployment workflow manually:

**Add file:** `.github/workflows/azure-deploy.yml`

```yaml
name: Deploy to Azure

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Build
        run: npm ci && npm run build

      - name: Deploy to Azure
        uses: Azure/static-web-apps-deploy@v1
        with:
          azure_static_web_apps_api_token: ${{ secrets.AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN_ASHY_PEBBLE_054BD1210 }}
          action: "upload"
          app_location: "/"
          output_location: "dist"
```

**Explain:**
> "This workflow automatically deploys our built app to Azure Static Web Apps whenever we push to the main branch. The secret token is stored securely in GitHub and used during deployment."

**Push and show the deployment workflow running.**

---

## Key Talking Points

- ✅ **Workflows are code:** YAML files, versioned, reviewed in PRs
- ✅ **Actions are reusable:** Pre-built by GitHub and community
- ✅ **Automation catches issues:** Dependencies, tests, deployments all automated
- ✅ **Transparent logs:** Every step is visible, easy to debug
- ✅ **Marketplace:** Thousands of ready-to-use actions for any use case

## Timing

- App demo: 2-3 min
- Create CI: 5-7 min
- Add Dependency Review: 3-5 min
- Push code: 2-3 min
- Watch workflows: 5-10 min
- Fix & re-run: 3-5 min
- Deploy (optional): 3-5 min

**Total: 15-20 minutes** ✓

## Quick Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Workflows don't run | Check Actions tab; they may take 30 sec to start |
| Dependency Review doesn't fail | Make sure `minimist@0.0.8` is in `package.json` |
| Tests fail | Verify `npm run test` works locally first |
| Confused about YAML? | Blame spaces/indentation; YAML is strict |

## Questions You Might Get

**Q: How do I know which actions to use?**  
A: GitHub Marketplace (https://github.com/marketplace) has thousands. Start with official GitHub actions, then community-maintained ones.

**Q: Can I use my own Docker image?**  
A: Yes! `docker://` syntax. But actions are simpler for most tasks.

**Q: What if a workflow fails in production?**  
A: Logs are always visible. You can re-run jobs, view artifacts, and debug step-by-step.

**Q: How do I keep workflows DRY (don't repeat yourself)?**  
A: Use reusable workflows and composite actions. We can discuss that in a follow-up.
